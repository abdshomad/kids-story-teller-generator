## üöÄ Technology Stack

This application orchestrates several cutting-edge AI services to create a seamless and magical experience.

-   **Frontend:**
    -   **React** & **TypeScript**
    -   **Tailwind CSS** for styling
    -   **Lucide React** for icons

-   **Core AI Services:**
    -   **Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`):** The primary engine for generating the story's narrative and transcribing user voice input.
    -   **FAL.ai (`nano-banana`):** The specialized model used to generate all the vibrant, stylized illustrations for the storybook.
    -   **ElevenLabs API:** Powers the high-quality, multilingual "Read Aloud" text-to-speech feature, providing natural-sounding narration.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Input:** The user provides a story prompt, either by typing or speaking. They can also provide an image for character inspiration and select various customization options.
2.  **Story Generation:** The prompt and options are sent to the **Google Gemini API**, which generates a complete story structured as a JSON object, including page text and prompts for illustrations.
3.  **Image Generation:** For each page, the generated illustration prompt is sent to the **FAL.ai API**, which creates a beautiful image in the user's selected style.
4.  **Assembly:** The application combines the text and images into a digital storybook format.
5.  **Narration (Optional):** If the user activates "Read Aloud", the text for each page is sent to the **ElevenLabs API** to generate audio, which is then played back in the browser.

## üõ°Ô∏è AI Ethics & Child Safety

The highest priority is child safety. System prompts sent to the AI include strict, non-negotiable instructions to generate content that is G-rated, positive, uplifting, and free of violence, fear, or any mature themes. We encourage co-reading and parental supervision to make story time a shared, creative adventure.
