## üöÄ Technology Stack

This application orchestrates several cutting-edge AI services to create a seamless and magical experience.

-   **Frontend:**
    -   **React** & **TypeScript**
    -   **Tailwind CSS** for styling
    -   **Lucide React** for icons

-   **Core AI Services:**
    -   **Google Gemini API (`gemini-2.5-flash`):** The primary "brain" of the application. It handles:
        -   Story outline, title, and synopsis generation.
        -   Full story text generation, structured into pages with narration and dialogue.
        -   Creation of image prompts and sound effect triggers for each page.
        -   Automatic character extraction from the user's prompt.
        -   Generating visual descriptions from user-uploaded images.
        -   Transcribing user voice input (Speech-to-Text).
    -   **FAL.ai (`nano-banana`):** The specialized model used to generate **all** the vibrant, stylized illustrations for the storybook, including cover options, character previews, and final page art.
    -   **ElevenLabs API:** Powers the high-quality, multilingual "Read Aloud" feature, providing natural-sounding narration for both the narrator and individual characters, as well as all sound effects.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1.  **Input & Customization:** The user provides a story prompt (typing or speaking), customizes options like theme and length, and can optionally add/edit characters with visual inspiration (upload/draw) and voice preferences.
2.  **Outline Generation (Step 1):** The prompt and character details are sent to the **Google Gemini API**, which returns a title, synopsis, and three distinct image prompts for a book cover, each with a different artistic style (e.g., "Style: Watercolor").
3.  **Cover Sketching:** These three prompts are sent to the **FAL.ai API**, which generates three beautiful cover images, giving the user a visual choice of styles.
4.  **Style Selection:** The user clicks their favorite cover. This choice locks in the artistic style for the rest of the book.
5.  **Full Story Generation (Step 2):** All the initial inputs, plus the chosen style, are sent back to the **Google Gemini API**. It then generates the complete, page-by-page story text, tailored image prompts for each page that match the chosen style, and identifies key moments for sound effects.
6.  **Illustration:** Each page's new image prompt is sent to **FAL.ai** to generate the final artwork.
7.  **Audio Generation:** The text for each page is sent to the **ElevenLabs API** to generate narration audio clips (using different voices for characters) and sound effects.
8.  **Assembly & Viewing:** The application combines the text, images, and audio into the final interactive digital storybook for the user to enjoy.

## üõ°Ô∏è AI Ethics & Child Safety

The highest priority is child safety. System prompts sent to the AI include strict, non-negotiable instructions to generate content that is G-rated, positive, uplifting, and free of violence, fear, or any mature themes. We encourage co-reading and parental supervision to make story time a shared, creative adventure.
